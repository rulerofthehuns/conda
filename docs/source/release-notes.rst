4.7.2 (2019-06-10)
==================

Behavior changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Unsatisfiability is determined in a slightly different way now. It no longer
  uses the SAT solver, but rather determines whether any specs have no
  candidates at all after running through get_reduced_index. This has been
  faster in benchmarks, but we welcome further data from your use cases about
  whether this was a good change.  (#8741)
* When using the --only-deps flag for the `install` command, conda now
  explicitly records those specs in your history. This primarily serves to
  reduce conda accidentally removing packages that you have actually requested.  (#8766)
  

Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* UnsatisfiableError messages are now grouped into categories and explained a bit better.  (#8741)
* --repodata-fn argument can be passed multiple times to have more fallback
  paths. `repodata_fns` conda config setting does the same thing, but saves you
  from needing to do it for every command invocation.  (#8741)


Bug fixes
^^^^^^^^^

* Fix channel flip-flopping that was happening when adding a channel other than earlier ones  (#8741)
* Refactor flow control for multiple repodata files to not use exceptions  (#8741)
* Force conda to use only old .tar.bz2 files if conda-build <3.18.3 is
  installed. Conda-build breaks when inspecting file contents; this is fixed
  in conda-build 3.18.3 (#8741)
* Use --force when using rsync to improve behavior with folders that may exist
  in the destination somehow. (#8750)
* Handle EPERM errors when renaming, because MacOS lets you remove or create
  files, but not rename them. Thanks, Apple. (#8755)
* Fix conda removing packages installed via `install` with --only-deps flag when
  either `update` or `remove` commands are run. See behavior changes above.

4.7.1 (2019-05-30)
==================

Improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Base initial solver specs map on explicitly requested specs (new and historic)  (#8689)
* Improve anonymization of automatic error reporting  (#8715)
* Add option to keep using .tar.bz2 files, in case new .conda isn't working for whatever reason  (#8723)

Bug fixes
^^^^^^^^^

* Fix parsing hyphenated PyPI specs (change hyphens in versions to .)  (#8688)
* Fix PrefixRecord creation when file inputs are .conda files  (#8689)
* Fix PrefixRecord creation for pip-installed packages  (#8689)
* Fix progress bar stopping at 75% (no extract progress with new libarchive)  (#8689)
* Preserve pre-4.7 download() interface in conda.exports  (#8698)
* Virtual packages (such as cuda) are represented by leading double underscores
  by convention, to avoid confusion with existing single underscore packages
  that serve other purposes (#8738)

Deprecations/Breaking changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* The `--prune` flag no longer does anything. Pruning is implicitly the
  standard behavior now as a result of the initial solver specs coming from
  explicitly requested specs. Conda will remove packages that are not explicitly
  requested and are not required directly or indirectly by any explicitly
  installed package.

Docs improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Document removal of the `free` channel from defaults (#8682)
* Add reference to conda config --describe  (#8712)
* Add a tutorial for .condarc modification  (#8737)

* Add optimization criterion to prefer arch over noarch packages when otherwise equivalent  (#8267)
* Remove `free` channel from defaults collection.  Add `restore_free_channel` config parameter if you want to keep it.  (#8579)

  on your system. If ran as UID 0 (i.e. root) on unix systems or as an
  Administrator user on Windows, all known conda environments for all users
  on the system will be searched.  For example, 'conda search --envs openssl'
  will show the openssl version and environment location for all
  conda-installed openssl packages.

4.4.0 (2017-12-20)
==================

Recommended change to enable conda in your shell
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

With the release of conda 4.4, we recommend a change to how the `conda` command is made available to your shell environment. All the old methods still work as before, but you'll need the new method to enable the new `conda activate` and `conda deactivate` commands.

For the "Anaconda Prompt" on Windows, there is no change.

For Bourne shell derivatives (bash, zsh, dash, etc.), you likely currently have a line similar to::

    export PATH="/opt/conda/bin:$PATH"

in your `~/.bashrc` file (or `~/.bash_profile` file on macOS).  The effect of this line is that your base environment is put on PATH, but without actually *activating* that environment. (In 4.4 we've renamed the 'root' environment to the 'base' environment.) With conda 4.4, we recommend removing the line where the `PATH` environment variable is modified, and replacing it with::

    . /opt/conda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
    conda activate base

In the above, it's assumed that `/opt/conda` is the location where you installed miniconda or Anaconda.  It may also be something like `~/Anaconda3` or `~/miniconda2`.

For system-wide conda installs, to make the `conda` command available to all users, rather than manipulating individual `~/.bashrc` (or `~/.bash_profile`) files for each user, just execute once::

    $ sudo ln -s /opt/conda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh /etc/profile.d/conda.sh

This will make the `conda` command itself available to all users, but conda's base (root) environment will *not* be activated by default.  Users will still need to run `conda activate base` to put the base environment on PATH and gain access to the executables in the base environment.

After updating to conda 4.4, we also recommend pinning conda to a specific channel.  For example, executing the command::

    $ conda config --system --add pinned_packages conda-canary::conda

will make sure that whenever conda is installed or changed in an environment, the source of the package is always being pulled from the `conda-canary` channel.  This will be useful for people who use `conda-forge`, to prevent conda from flipping back and forth between 4.3 and 4.4.


New feature highlights
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* **conda activate**: The logic and mechanisms underlying environment activation have been reworked. With conda 4.4, `conda activate` and `conda deactivate` are now the preferred commands for activating and deactivating environments. You'll find they are much more snappy than the `source activate` and `source deactivate` commands from previous conda versions. The `conda activate` command also has advantages of (1) being universal across all OSes, shells, and platforms, and (2) not having path collisions with scripts from other packages like Python virtualenv's activate script.


* **constrained, optional dependencies**: Conda now allows a package to constrain versions of other packages installed alongside it, even if those constrained packages are not themselves hard dependencies for that package. In other words, it lets a package specify that, if another package ends up being installed into an environment, it must at least conform to a certain version specification. In effect, constrained dependencies are a type of "reverse" dependency. It gives a tool to a parent package to exclude other packages from an environment that might otherwise want to depend on it.

  Constrained optional dependencies are supported starting with conda-build 3.0 (via `conda/conda-build#2001 <https://github.com/conda/conda-build/pull/2001>`_). A new `run_constrained` keyword, which takes a list of package specs similar to the `run` keyword, is recognized under the `requirements` section of `meta.yaml`. For backward compatibility with versions of conda older than 4.4, a requirement may be listed in both the `run` and the `run_constrained` section. In that case older versions of conda will see the package as a hard dependency, while conda 4.4 will understand that the package is meant to be optional.

  Optional, constrained dependencies end up in `repodata.json` under a `constrains` keyword, parallel to the `depends` keyword for a package's hard dependencies.


* **enhanced package query language**: Conda has a built-in query language for searching for and matching packages, what we often refer to as `MatchSpec`. The MatchSpec is what users input on the command line when they specify packages for `create`, `install`, `update`, and `remove` operations. With this release, MatchSpec (rather than a regex) becomes the default input for `conda search`. We have also substantially enhanced our MatchSpec query language.

  For example::

      conda install conda-forge::Python

  is now a valid command, which specifies that regardless of the active list of channel priorities, the Python package itself should come from the `conda-forge` channel. As before, the difference between `Python=3.5` and `Python==3.5` is that the first contains a "*fuzzy*" version while the second contains an *exact* version. The fuzzy spec will match all Python packages with versions `>=3.5` and `<3.6`. The exact spec will match only Python packages with version `3.5`, `3.5.0`, `3.5.0.0`, etc. The canonical string form for a MatchSpec is thus::

      (channel::)name(version(build_string))

  which should feel natural to experienced conda users. Specifications however are often necessarily more complicated than this simple form can support, and for these situations we've extended the specification to include an optional square bracket `[]` component containing comma-separated key-value pairs to allow matching on most any field contained in a package's metadata. Take, for example::

      conda search 'conda-forge/linux-64::*[md5=e42a03f799131d5af4196ce31a1084a7]' --info

  which results in information for the single package::

      cytoolz 0.8.2 py35_0
      --------------------
      file name   : cytoolz-0.8.2-py35_0.tar.bz2
      name        : cytoolz
      version     : 0.8.2
      build string: py35_0
      build number: 0
      size        : 1.1 MB
      arch        : x86_64
      platform    : Platform.linux
      license     : BSD 3-Clause
      subdir      : linux-64
      url         : https://conda.anaconda.org/conda-forge/linux-64/cytoolz-0.8.2-py35_0.tar.bz2
      md5         : e42a03f799131d5af4196ce31a1084a7
      dependencies:
        - Python 3.5*
        - toolz >=0.8.0

  The square bracket notation can also be used for any field that we match on outside the package name, and will override information given in the "simple form" position. To give a contrived example, `Python==3.5[version='>=2.7,<2.8']` will match `2.7.*` versions and not `3.5`.


* **environments track user-requested state**: Building on our enhanced MatchSpec query language, conda environments now also track and differentiate (a) packages added to an environment because of an explicit user request from (b) packages brought into an environment to satisfy dependencies. For example, executing::

      conda install conda-forge::scikit-learn

  will confine all future changes to the scikit-learn package in the environment to the conda-forge channel, until the spec is changed again. A subsequent command `conda install scikit-learn=0.18` would drop the `conda-forge` channel restriction from the package. And in this case, scikit-learn is the only user-defined spec, so the solver chooses dependencies from all configured channels and all available versions.


* **errors posted to core maintainers**: In previous versions of conda, unexpected errors resulted in a request for users to consider posting the error as a new issue on conda's github issue tracker. In conda 4.4, we've implemented a system for users to opt-in to sending that same error report via an HTTP POST request directly to the core maintainers.

  When an unexpected error is encountered, users are prompted with the error report followed by a `[y/N]` input. Users can elect to send the report, with 'no' being the default response. Users can also permanently opt-in or opt-out, thereby skipping the prompt altogether, using the boolean `report_errors` configuration parameter.


* **various UI improvements**: To push through some of the big leaps with transactions in conda 4.3, we accepted some regressions on progress bars and other user interface features. All of those indicators of progress, and more, have been brought back and further improved.


* **aggressive updates**: Conda now supports an `aggressive_update_packages` configuration parameter that holds a sequence of MatchSpec strings, in addition to the `pinned_packages` configuration parameter. Currently, the default value contains the packages `ca-certificates`, `certifi`, and `openssl`. When manipulating configuration with the `conda config` command, use of the `--system` and `--env` flags will be especially helpful here. For example::

      conda config --add aggressive_update_packages defaults::pyopenssl --system

  would ensure that, system-wide, solves on all environments enforce using the latest version of `pyopenssl` from the `defaults` channel.

  ```conda config --add pinned_packages Python=2.7 --env```

  would lock all solves for the current active environment to Python versions matching `2.7.*`.


* **other configuration improvements**: In addition to `conda config --describe`, which shows detailed descriptions and default values for all available configuration parameters, we have a new `conda config --write-default` command. This new command simply writes the contents of `conda config --describe` to a condarc file, which is a great starter template. Without additional arguments, the command will write to the `.condarc` file in the user's home directory. The command also works with the `--system`, `--env`, and `--file` flags to write the contents to alternate locations.

  Conda exposes a tremendous amount of flexibility via configuration. For more information, `The Conda Configuration Engine for Power Users <https://www.continuum.io/blog/developer-blog/conda-configuration-engine-power-users>`_ blog post is a good resource.

4.3.0 (2016-12-14) Safety
=========================

New features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* **Unlink and Link Packages in a Single Transaction**: In the past, conda hasn't always been safe
  and defensive with its disk-mutating actions. It has gleefully clobbered existing files, and
  mid-operation failures leave environments completely broken. In some of the most severe examples,
  conda can appear to "uninstall itself." With this release, the unlinking and linking of packages
  for an executed command is done in a single transaction. If a failure occurs for any reason
  while conda is mutating files on disk, the environment will be returned its previous state.
  While we've implemented some pre-transaction checks (verifying package integrity for example),
  it's impossible to anticipate every failure mechanism. In some circumstances, OS file
  permissions cannot be fully known until an operation is attempted and fails. And conda itself
  is not without bugs. Moving forward, unforeseeable failures won't be catastrophic. (#3833, #4030)

* **Progressive Fetch and Extract Transactions**: Like package unlinking and linking, the
  download and extract phases of package handling have also been given transaction-like behavior.
  The distinction is the rollback on error is limited to a single package. Rather than rolling back
  the download and extract operation for all packages, the single-package rollback prevents the
  need for having to re-download every package if an error is encountered. (#4021, #4030)

* **Generic- and Python-Type Noarch/Universal Packages**: Along with conda-build 2.1.0, a
  noarch/universal type for Python packages is officially supported. These are much like universal
  Python wheels. Files in a Python noarch package are linked into a prefix just like any other
  conda package, with the following additional features:

  1. conda maps the `site-packages` directory to the correct location for the Python version
     in the environment,
  2. conda maps the Python-scripts directory to either $PREFIX/bin or $PREFIX/Scripts depending
     on platform,
  3. conda creates the Python entry points specified in the conda-build recipe, and
  4. conda compiles pyc files at install time when prefix write permissions are guaranteed.

  Python noarch packages must be "fully universal."  They cannot have OS- or
  Python version-specific dependencies.  They cannot have OS- or Python version-specific "scripts"
  files. If these features are needed, traditional conda packages must be used. (#3712)

* **Multi-User Package Caches**: While the on-disk package cache structure has been preserved,
  the core logic implementing package cache handling has had a complete overhaul.  Writable and
  read-only package caches are fully supported. (#4021)

* **Python API Module**: An oft requested feature is the ability to use conda as a Python library,
  obviating the need to "shell out" to another Python process. Conda 4.3 includes a
  `conda.cli.python_api` module that facilitates this use case. While we maintain the user-facing
  command-line interface, conda commands can be executed in-process. There is also a
  `conda.exports` module to facilitate longer-term usage of conda as a library across conda
  conda releases.  However, conda's Python code *is* considered internal and private, subject
  to change at any time across releases. At the moment, conda will not install itself into
  environments other than its original install environment. (#4028)

* **Remove All Locks**:  Locking has never been fully effective in conda, and it often created a
  false sense of security. In this release, multi-user package cache support has been
  implemented for improved safety by hard-linking packages in read-only caches to the user's
  primary user package cache. Still, users are cautioned that undefined behavior can result when
  conda is running in multiple process and operating on the same package caches and/or
  environments. (#3862)

Deprecations/Breaking changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Conda now has the ability to refuse to clobber existing files that are not within the unlink
  instructions of the transaction.  This behavior is configurable via the `path_conflict`
  configuration option, which has three possible values: `clobber`, `warn`, and `prevent`. In 4.3,
  the default value will be `clobber`.  That will give package maintainers time to correct current
  incompatibilities within their package ecosystem. In 4.4, the default will switch to `warn`,
  which means these operations continue to clobber, but the warning messages are displayed.  In
  `4.5`, the default value will switch to `prevent`.  As we tighten up the `path_conflict`
  constraint, a new command line flag `--clobber` will loosen it back up on an *ad hoc* basis.
  Using `--clobber` overrides the setting for `path_conflict` to effectively be `clobber` for
  that operation.
* Conda signed packages have been removed in 4.3. Vulnerabilities existed. An illusion of security
  is worse than not having the feature at all.  We will be incorporating The Update Framework
  into conda in a future feature release. (#4064)
* Conda 4.4 will drop support for older versions of conda-build.

4.2.0 (2016-07-28)
==================

New features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

* **New Configuration Engine**: Configuration and "operating context" are the foundation of conda's functionality. Conda now has the ability to pull configuration information from a multitude of on-disk locations, including ``.d`` directories and a ``.condarc`` file *within* a conda environment), along with full ``CONDA_`` environment variable support. Helpful validation errors are given for improperly-specified configuration. Full documentation updates pending. (#2537, #3160, #3178)
* **New Exception Handling Engine**: Previous releases followed a pattern of premature exiting (with hard calls to ``sys.exit()``) when exceptional circumstances were encountered. This release replaces over 100 ``sys.exit`` calls with Python exceptions.  For conda developers, this will result in tests that are easier to write.  For developers using conda, this is a first step on a long path toward conda being directly importable.  For conda users, this will eventually result in more helpful and descriptive errors messages.  (#2899, #2993, #3016, #3152, #3045)
* **Empty Environments**: Conda can now create "empty" environments when no initial packages are specified, alleviating a common source of confusion. (#3072, #3174)
* **Conda in Private Env**: Conda can now be configured to live within its own private environment.  While it's not yet default behavior, this represents a first step toward separating the ``root`` environment into a "conda private" environment and a "user default" environment. (#3068)
* **Regex Version Specification**: Regular expressions are now valid version specifiers.  For example, ``^1\.[5-8]\.1$|2.2``. (#2933)

4.1.0 (2016-06-14)
==================

This release contains many small bug fixes for all operating systems, and a few
special fixes for Windows behavior.

Notable changes for all systems (Windows, macOS, and Linux)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* **Channel order now matters.** The most significant conda change is that
  when you add channels, channel order matters. If you have a list of channels
  in a .condarc file, conda installs the package from the first channel where
  it's available, even if it's available in a later channel with a higher
  version number.
* **No version downgrades.** Conda remove no longer performs version
  downgrades on any remaining packages that might be suggested to resolve
  dependency losses; the package will just be removed instead.
* **New YAML parser/emitter.** PyYAML is replaced with ruamel.yaml,
  which gives more robust control over yaml document use.
  `More on ruamel.yaml <http://yaml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
* **Shebang lines over 127 characters are now truncated (Linux, macOS only).**
  `Shebangs <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)>`_ are
  the first line of the many executable scripts that tell the operating
  system how to execute the program.  They start with ``#!``. Most OSes
  don't support these lines over 127 characters, so conda now checks
  the length and replaces the full interpreter path in long lines with
  ``/usr/bin/env``. When you're working in a conda environment that
  is deeply under many directories, or you otherwise have long paths
  to your conda environment, make sure you activate that environment
  now.
* **Changes to conda list command.** When looking for packages that
  aren’t installed with conda, conda list now examines the Python
  site-packages directory rather than relying on pip.
* **Changes to conda remove command.** The command  ``conda remove --all``
  now removes a conda environment without fetching information from a remote
  server on the packages in the environment.
* **Conda update can be turned off and on.** When turned off, conda will
  not update itself unless the user manually issues a conda update command.
  Previously conda updated any time a user updated or installed a package
  in the root environment. Use the option ``conda config set auto_update_conda false``.
* **Improved support for BeeGFS.** BeeGFS is a parallel cluster file
  system for performance and designed for easy installation and
  management. `More on BeeGFS <http://www.beegfs.com/content/documentation/>`_

Windows-only changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* **Shortcuts are no longer installed by default on Windows.** Shortcuts can
  now be installed with the ``--shortcuts`` option. Example 1: Install a shortcut
  to Spyder with ``conda install spyder --shortcut``. Note if you have Anaconda
  (not Miniconda), you already have this shortcut and Spyder. Example 2:
  Install the open source package named ``console_shortcut``. When you click
  the shortcut icon, a terminal window will open with the environment
  containing the ``console_shortcut`` package already activated. ``conda install
  console_shortcut --shortcuts``
* **Skip binary replacement on Windows.** Linux & macOS have binaries that
  are coded with library locations, and this information must sometimes be
  replaced for relocatability, but Windows does not generally embed prefixes
  in binaries, and was already relocatable. We skip binary replacement on
  Windows.

* The solver has been retooled significantly. Performance should be improved in most circumstances, and a number of issues involving feature conflicts should be resolved.

* `conda update <package>` now handles depedencies properly according to the setting of the "update_deps" configuration:

    --update-deps: conda will also update any dependencies as needed to install the latest verison of the requrested packages.  The minimal set of changes required to achieve this is sought.

    --no-update-deps: conda will update the packages *only* to the extent that no updates to the dependencies are required

  The previous behavior, which would update the packages without regard to their dependencies, could result in a broken configuration, and has been removed.

* Disable the max_only heuristic during hint generation
* New version comparison algorithm, which consistently compares any version string, and better handles version strings using things like alpha, beta, rc, post, and dev. This should remove any inconsistent version comparison that would lead to conda installing an incorrect version.
* Use the trash in rm_rf, meaning more things will get the benefit of the trash system on Windows
* Add the ability to pass the --file argument multiple times

===================

* Fix conda with older versions of argcomplete
* Restore the --force-pscheck option as a no-op for backwards compatibility


3.15.0 (2015-07-22)
===================

* Sort the output of conda info package correctly

* Conda extensions that import conda should use conda.cli.conda_argparser.ArgumentParser instead of argparse.ArgumentParser to conform to the conda help guidelines (e.g., all help messages should be capitalized with periods, and the options should be preceded by "Options:" for the sake of help2man).
* Add confirmation dialog to conda remove. Fixes conda remove --dry-run.

3.11.0 (2015-04-22)
===================

* Fix issue where forced update on Windows could cause a package to break

* Add ability to disable self update of conda, by setting "self_update: False" in .condarc
* Try installing packages using the old way of just installing the maximum versions of things first. This provides a major speedup of solving the package specifications in the cases where this scheme works.
* Don't include Python=3.3 in the specs automatically for the Python 3 version of conda.  This allows you to do "conda create -n env package" for a package that only has a Python 2 version without specifying "Python=2". This change has no effect in Python 2.
* Automatically put symlinks to conda, activate, and deactivate in each environment on Linux and macOS.
* On Linux and macOS, activate and deactivate now remove the root environment from the PATH.

* Conda contains a brand new logic submodule for converting pseudo-boolean constraints into SAT clauses.

3.1.1 (2014-03-07)
==================

* Check if directory exists, fixed issue #591
